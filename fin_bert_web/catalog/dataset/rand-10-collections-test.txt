1417663_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	Item 1 . We are an emerging global regenerative medicine company focused on the development and commercialization of non-invasive, biological response activating devices for the repair and regeneration of tissue, musculoskeletal and vascular structures.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P0_S1	Our portfolio of products and product candidates activate biologic signaling and angiogenic responses, including new vascularization and microcirculatory improvement, helping to restore the body s normal healing processes and regeneration. We intend to apply our Pulsed Acoustic Cellular Expression (PACE ) technology in wound healing, orthopedic/spine, plastic/cosmetic and cardiac conditions.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our lead device product for the global wound care market, dermaPACE , has recently completed its pivotal Phase III, Investigational Device Exemption ( IDE ) trial in the United States for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P1_S1	We received permission by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the FDA ) through the acceptance of our shell application in August 2010 to file the pre-market approval ( PMA ) for dermaPACE in a series of three sections or modules .
1417663_11_ITEM1_P1_S2	This first module included preclinical data and results of prior clinical testing and was filed in December 2010. The second module containing a quality manufacturing system review was submitted in January 2011. We expect to file the third module containing data from the recently completed pivotal Phase III clinical trial of dermaPACE to treat diabetic foot ulcers, proposed product labeling and a summary of safety and effectiveness in the second quarter of 2011.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P1_S3	The dermaPACE has received the European Conformity Marking ( CE Mark ) allowing for commercial use on acute and chronic defects of the skin and subcutaneous soft tissue.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	We research, design, manufacture, market and service our products worldwide and believe we have already demonstrated that our PACE technology is safe and effective in stimulating healing in chronic conditions of the foot and the elbow through our United States FDA Class III PMA approved Ossatron device, and in the stimulation of bone and chronic tendonitis regeneration in the musculoskeletal environment through the utilization of our Ossatron, Evotron , and newly introduced orthoPACE devices in Europe.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	We are focused on developing our PACE technology to activate healing in: wound conditions, including diabetic foot ulcers, venous ulcers, pressure sores, burns and other skin eruption conditions; orthopedic/spine applications, such as speeding the healing of fractures (including nonunion or delayed-union conditions), improving bone density in osteoporosis, fusing bones in the extremities and spine, eliminating chronic pain in joints from trauma or arthritis, and other potential sports injury applications; plastic/cosmetic applications such as cellulite smoothing, graft and transplant acceptance, skin tightening, scarring and other potential aesthetic uses; and cardiac applications for removing plaque due to atherosclerosis and improving heart muscle performance. We believe our experience from our preclinical research and the clinical use of our predecessor legacy devices in Europe and Asia, as well as our Ossatron device in the United States, demonstrates the safety, clinical utility and efficacy of our product candidates.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P3_S1	In addition, we have preclinical programs focused on the development and better understanding of treatments specific to our target applications, as well as the development of next generation devices utilizing our PACE technology to maximize healing response and intervention.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	We believe that our studies suggest that our PACE technology will be effective in our target If successful, we anticipate that these clinical studies should lead to regulatory approval of our regenerative product candidates in the United States, Europe and Asia.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P4_S1	If approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities, we believe that our product candidates will offer new, effective and non-invasive treatment options in wound healing, orthopedic/spine injuries, plastic/cosmetic uses and cardiac procedures, improving the quality of life for millions of patients suffering from injuries or deterioration of tissue, bones and vascular structures.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	Table of Contents Organization; Reverse Merger Transaction The Company is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the state of Nevada.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P5_S1	The Company was incorporated on May 6, 2004.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P5_S2	On September 25, 2009, the Company (formerly named Rub Music Enterprises, Inc.) and RME Delaware Merger Sub, Inc., a Nevada corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the Merger Sub ) entered into a reverse merger agreement (the Merger Agreement ) with SANUWAVE, Inc., a Delaware corporation.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P5_S3	Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Merger Sub merged with and into SANUWAVE, Inc., with SANUWAVE, Inc. as the surviving entity (the Merger ). In connection with the Merger, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding capital stock of SANUWAVE, Inc. and the stockholders of SANUWAVE, Inc. received 11,009,657 shares of the Company s common stock, Class A warrants to purchase 1,106,627 shares of the Company s common stock at $4.00 per share, and Class B warrants to purchase an additional 1,106,627 shares of the Company s common stock at $8.00 per share.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P5_S4	In addition, in connection with the Merger, certain stockholders of the Company agreed to cancel all of their shares of common stock of the Company, except for 1,500,000 shares of common stock, for an aggregate price of $180,000 (the Share Repurchase ). At the time of the Merger, the Company had 1,500,000 Class C warrants outstanding to purchase the Company s common stock at $4.00 per share.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	As a result of the Merger and the Share Repurchase, the stockholders of SANUWAVE, Inc.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	controlled approximately 88% of the Company s outstanding common stock, holding 11,009,657 of the 12,509,657 outstanding shares, and SANUWAVE, Inc. was considered the accounting acquirer in this The Company was a shell company as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ) immediately prior to the Merger.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P6_S2	As a result of the Merger, the Company s operations are now focused in global medical technology and the Company is no longer a shell company.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	Pulsed Acoustic Cellular Expression ( PACE ) Technology Our PACE product candidates, including our lead product candidate, dermaPACE, utilize high energy, acoustic pressure waves in the shockwave spectrum to enhance new blood vessel formation, and soft tissue and bone regeneration.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P7_S1	PACE pressure waves combine compressive and tensile stresses on cells and structures to promote an inflammatory response in musculoskeletal and soft tissue, resulting in microcirculatory improvement, including the production of angiogenic growth factors, enhanced new blood vessel formation (angiogenesis) and subsequent regeneration of tissue.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	PACE waves are different from other forms of acoustic energy, such as ultrasound, in that the wave front, in which the compressive forces exist, is a region of sudden and forceful change in stress, density and temperature, which positively regulates the inflammatory response and reinitiates cellular proliferation phases, allowing the body s own healing response to reinitiate or be We believe that our PACE technology is well suited for various applications due to its activation of a broad spectrum of cellular events critical for the initiation and progression of High energy, acoustic pressure waves in the shockwave spectrum are the primary component of our previously developed product, Ossatron, which was approved and marketed in the United States for use in chronic tendonitis of the foot in 2000 and the elbow in 2003.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	Additionally, acoustic shockwaves have been used safely at much higher energy and pulse levels in the lithotripsy procedure (breaking up kidney stones) by urologists for over 20 years and has reached standard of care status. dermaPACE Our lead product candidate We have completed our multi-site, randomized, double-blind, sham controlled FDA IDE wound care clinical study focused on the healing of diabetic foot ulcers utilizing our lead product candidate, dermaPACE, and released top-line data.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	The primary study goal is to establish superiority in diabetic foot ulcer healing rates using the dermaPACE treatment compared to sham control, when both are combined with the current standard of care.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P9_S2	The standard of care includes wet-to-dry dressings, the most widely used primary dressing material in the United States, and offloading with a walking boot for ulcers located on the plantar surface of the foot.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P9_S3	A total of 206 patients were enrolled and randomized in the dermaPACE study at 24 sites.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P9_S4	The patients in the study were followed for a total of 24 weeks.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P9_S5	The study s primary endpoint of wound closure was defined as 100% skin re -epithelialization without drainage or dressing requirements confirmed at two consecutive visits, 2-4 weeks apart.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	Secondary clinical trial endpoints included time to closure, reduction in total wound surface area and volume, rate of improvement, long-term safety, and skin appearance and pain assessments. Table of Contents Unlike many other chronic wound trials conducted in the diabetic patient population, there were two important, rigorous elements incorporated in the dermaPACE study design: double-blind (patient and principal investigator) randomization, and elimination of the option to close target ulcer surgically or by other primary means.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	Maintaining the double-blind in this device trial restricted the knowledge of the treatment assignment so not to influence how a patient was treated or maintained on study and evaluated.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P10_S2	This eliminated unintended human bias and qualifies this research as level 1 evidence, allowing the results to be accepted at face value.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P10_S3	not allowing the clinical investigators to surgically close the target ulcer in this clinical trial, the results provide a clear and unbiased view of the granulation and epithelialization process attributable to dermaPACE alone.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	Patients treated with dermaPACE showed a strong positive trend in the primary endpoint of 100% wound closure. Treatment with dermaPACE increased the proportion of diabetic foot ulcers that closed within 12 weeks by 36%, although this result was not statistically significant.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	Based on the pure, controlled design of the study, which blinded both investigators and patients and restricted investigators from closing wounds surgically, we analyzed a clinically relevant 90% wound closure endpoint that demonstrated statistical significance (p=0.0161) in favor of dermaPACE (51/107, 48%) compared to patients randomized to receive Sham control (31/99, 31%).
1417663_11_ITEM1_P11_S2	The median wound closure exceeded 99% for the dermaPACE treated patients who achieved at least 90% wound closure, and these patients had only a 4.5% recurrence rate at 24 weeks.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	Importantly, there were no device-related adverse events associated with the dermaPACE procedures reported during the course of the clinical trial, and no issues regarding the tolerability of the treatment. This suggests that a second course of treatment, if needed, is a clinically viable option. Based on the results of the clinical trial, the dermaPACE was shown to: significantly accelerate the rate of diabetic foot ulcer closure; cause highly significant reductions in ulcer size; have an extremely low rate of ulcer recurrence; and not be associated with any device-related adverse events.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	We have filed the first two modules of the three of our PMA.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	We expect to file our final module with the FDA in the second quarter of 2011 and, pending a favorable response from the FDA, to launch dermaPACE in the United States in early 2012.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	Prior to receiving FDA approval, we intend to begin the process of initiating private industry payor meetings in the United States to introduce the economics and positive efficacy results of These discussions will focus on building knowledge of dermaPACE and educating to the positive value proposition compared to existing alternatives.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	We will also begin the process of obtaining a new Category III Current Procedural Terminology ( CPT ) code for dermaPACE for Medicare tracking purposes, which is a requisite first step in obtaining medical reimbursement for We believe that, in addition to improving the quality of life of the patients treated, dermaPACE will provide cost benefits to payors, employers and society as a whole through improved healing, shortened healing times, and fewer and less burdensome required procedures.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	In addition, our dermaPACE device has received the European CE Mark approval to treat acute and chronic defects of the skin and subcutaneous soft tissue, such as in the treatment of pressure ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, burns, and traumatic and surgical wounds.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	We are actively marketing dermaPACE to the European Community utilizing distributors in select countries.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	Growth Opportunity in Wound Care Treatment We are focused on the development of products that treat unmet medical needs in large market Currently, there are limited biological or mechanical therapies to activate the healing and regeneration of tissue, bone and vascular structures.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P16_S1	As baby boomers age, the incidence of their targeted diseases and musculoskeletal injuries and ailments will be far more We believe that our PACE technology is well positioned to address many of these issues.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	We believe that our PACE technology, in promoting tissue regeneration, can be effective in a broad array of applications and address unmet medical needs in wound healing, orthopedic/spine, plastic/cosmetic and cardiac conditions. Table of Contents Our primary interest is developing our lead product candidate, dermaPACE, for the global wound care market, with the first focus in the United States on diabetic foot ulcers.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	Diabetes is common, disabling and deadly. In the United States, diabetes has reached epidemic proportions.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P17_S2	According to the American Diabetes Association, about 25.8 million people (8.3% of the total United States population) have diabetes, and nearly two million new cases are diagnosed in people aged 20 years or older each year.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P17_S3	If current trends continue, 1 in 3 Americans will develop diabetes at some point in their lifetime, and those with diabetes will lose, on average, 10-15 years of life expectancy.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P17_S4	Importantly, up to 25% of people with diabetes will develop a diabetic foot ulcer, resulting in 3 million diabetic foot ulcers annually in the United States alone. More than half of all foot ulcers will become infected, thus requiring hospitalization, and 1 in 5 will require an amputation that carries a high risk of mortality.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P17_S5	Diabetes puts tremendous economic pressure on the United States healthcare system.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P17_S6	In January 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the CDC ) reported the total costs (direct and indirect) of diabetes in the United States is $174 billion annually, and people with diagnosed diabetes have medical expenditures that are over two times higher than medical expenditures for people without diabetes. Hospitalization costs alone are $16,000 to $20,000 for a patient with a diabetic foot ulcer, and direct and indirect costs of an amputation range from $20,000 to $60,000 per patient. Advanced, cost-effective treatment modalities for diabetes and its comorbidities, including diabetic foot ulcers, are in great need, yet in short supply, globally.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P17_S7	According to the American Diabetes Association, by the year 2025 the prevalence of diabetes is expected to rise by 72% to 324 million people worldwide.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	A majority of challenging wounds are non-healing chronic wounds.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	These wounds often involve physiologic, complex and multiple complications such as reduced blood supply, compromised systems or immune deficiencies that interfere with the body s normal wound healing processes.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P18_S2	addition, diabetic ulcers and pressure ulcers are often slow-to-heal wounds.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P18_S3	These wounds often develop due to a patient s impaired vascular and tissue repair capabilities.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P18_S4	These conditions can also inhibit a patient s healing process, and often fail to heal for many months, and sometimes, for several years. Wounds that are difficult to treat do not always respond to traditional therapies, which include hydrocolloids, hydrogels and alginates.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	We believe that physicians and hospitals need a therapy that addresses the special needs of these wounds with high levels of both clinical and cost effectiveness. We believe we are developing a safe and advanced technology in the wound healing and tissue regeneration market with PACE. dermaPACE is non-invasive and does not require anesthesia, making it a cost-effective, time-efficient and painless approach to wound care.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P19_S1	Physicians and nurses look for therapies that can accelerate the healing process and overcome the obstacles of patients compromised conditions, and prefer therapies that are easy to administer.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P19_S2	In addition, since many of these patients are not confined to bed, healthcare providers want therapies that are minimally disruptive to the patient s or the caregiver s daily routines.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P19_S3	dermaPACE s non-invasive treatment is designed to elicit the body s own healing response.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P19_S4	dermaPACE s simple protocol of four treatments over a two week period, followed by simple standard of care dressing changes, are designed to allow for limited disruption to the patients normal lives and have no effect on mobility while their wounds heal.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our clinical experiences have demonstrated the ability of dermaPACE to promote wound healing, improve healing time and help prevent chronic conditions, such as diabetic foot ulcers, from leading to amputation. Our dermaPACE device has been used safely in Europe and Asia for various types of acute and chronic wounds.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	Developing Product Opportunities Orthopedic and Spine We launched the orthoPACE device in Europe which is intended for use in orthopedic, trauma and sports medicine indications following CE Mark approval in June 2010.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	The device features a new, unique applicator that is less painful for some indications and may reduce or completely eliminate anesthesia for some patients. In the orthopedic setting, the orthoPACE will initially be used to treat tendinopathies and acute and nonunion fractures, including the soft tissue surrounding the fracture to accelerate healing and prevent secondary complications and their associated treatment The first shipments to Europe of the new orthoPACE device were made in the third quarter of We have established clinical, manufacturing and development relationships and multiple regulatory pathways to product development.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	We believe that these relationships and pathways, coupled with the well-characterized biologic response, history of safe use and clinically-proven efficacy of our PACE technology, all position us to become a leader in the development and commercialization of non-invasive, biological response devices for the repair and regeneration of tissue, musculoskeletal and vascular structures that will capitalize on the growing market for these products in wound healing, orthopedic/spine, plastic/cosmetic and cardiac applications.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P22_S2	Although the results of our studies have been positive to date, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in developing, obtaining regulatory approval for, or commercializing current product candidates, or that we will do so in a timely fashion.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	Table of Contents We believe there are significant opportunities in the worldwide orthopedic and spine markets, driven by aging baby boomers, the desire for active lifestyles well into retirement and the growth in the incidence of osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, obesity, diabetes and other diseases that cause injury to orthopedic tissues and/or impair the ability of the body to heal injuries.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	Trauma injuries are acute and result from any physical damage to the body caused by violence or accident or fracture. Surgical treatment of traumatic fractures often involves fixation with metallic plates, screws and rods (internal fixation) and include off-loading to prevent motion, permitting the body to initiate a healing response.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	In the United States, six million traumatic fractures are treated each year, and over one million internal fixation procedures are performed annually. The prevalence of non-union among these fractures is between 2.5% and 10.0% depending on the fracture type and risk factors such as diabetes and smoking history or other systemic diseases.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P24_S2	At the time of surgery, adjunctive agents (such as autograft, cadaver bone and synthetic filling materials) are often implanted along with internal fixation to fill bony gaps or facilitate the healing process to avoid delayed union or non-union (incomplete fracture healing) results. Both pre-clinical and clinical investigations have shown positive results, suggesting our technology could potentially be developed as an adjunct to these surgeries or primary treatment protocol for delayed or non-union events.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	We have had a long history in the sports medicine field that generally refers to the non-surgical and surgical management of cartilage, ligament and tendon injuries through our legacy device, Ossatron. Common examples of these injuries include extremity joint pain, torn rotator cuffs (shoulder), tennis elbow, Achilles tendon tears and torn meniscus cartilage in the knee.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	Injuries to these structures are very difficult to treat because the body has a limited natural ability to regenerate these tissues.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P25_S2	Cartilage, ligament and tendons seldom return to a pre-injury state of function. Due to a lack of therapies that can activate healing and regenerate these tissues, many of these injuries will result in a degree of permanent impairment and chronic pain.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P25_S3	Prior investigations and new pre-clinical work indicate that PACE can activate various cell types and be an important adjunct to the management of sports medicine injuries.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	Spinal fusion is a surgical technique performed to correct an unstable part of the spine by joining two or more vertebrae, such as degenerative disc disease (DDD), which can no longer be managed with conservative methods. There are over 500,000 spinal fusions performed in the United States annually on vertebrae of the lower back (lumbar) or neck region (cervical).
1417663_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	surgeons often will take bone from another part of the body (i.e. hip), known as autograft, and use it to fill the space between adjacent vertebrae.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P26_S2	However, some disadvantages include the need to perform a second surgery, additional operative time, the potential for post-operative complications and long-term pain at the graft site.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P26_S3	Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) have also been used as a replacement for autograft in spinal fusion surgery; however, they have been associated with some severe and potentially life-threatening side effects, particularly when used in the neck region.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P26_S4	PACE has been shown to be safe and effective in a pilot, rabbit model.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	Market Trends We are focused on the development of products that have the potential to address substantial unmet clinical needs across broad market indications.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	We believe there are limited therapeutic treatments that directly and reproducibly activate healing processes in the areas in which we are focusing, particularly for wound care and repair of certain types of musculoskeletal conditions.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	According to AdvaMed, Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services and our internal projections for dermaPACE, the United States advanced wound healing market for the dermaPACE is estimated at $5 billion, which includes diabetic foot ulcers, pressure sores, burns and traumatic wounds, and chronic mixed leg ulcers. We also believe there are significant opportunities in the worldwide orthopedic and spine markets, driven by aging baby boomers, the desire for active lifestyles well into retirement and the growth in the incidence of osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, obesity, diabetes and other diseases that cause injury to orthopedic tissues and/or impair the ability of the body to heal injuries. With the success of negative pressure wound therapy devices in the wound care market over the last ten years and the recognition of the global epidemic associated with wounds, as well as deteriorating musculoskeletal conditions attributed to various disease states such as obesity, diabetes and ischemia due to vascular and heart disease, as well as sports injuries, we believe that Medicare and private insurers have become aware of the costs and expenditures associated with the adjunctive therapies being utilized for wound healing and orthopedic/spine conditions with limited efficacies in full skin closure, or bone and tissue regeneration.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P28_S1	We believe the wound healing and orthopedic markets are undergoing a transition, and are interested in biological response activating devices that are applied non-invasively and seek to activate the body s own capabilities for regeneration of tissue at injury sites in a cost-effective manner.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	Table of Contents Our objective is to be a leader in the development and commercialization of novel, biological response activating devices to treat tissue, musculoskeletal and vascular structure conditions.
1417663_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	Our main vehicle for growth is the development and commercialization of our PACE technology.
